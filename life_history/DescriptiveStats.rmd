I will be following the following [course](https://raisahernandez.github.io/PrimatePopEcolTraining/M.2_pre.html).
And the Vervet dataset.

```{r}
library(rstatix)
```

The code chunk appears:
```{r}
d <- read.csv("/Users/mariagranell/Repositories/phllipe_vulloid/tbl_Creation/tbl_maria/factchecked_LH.csv")
head(d)
```

Type any R code in the chunk, for example:
```{r, echo = F}
summary_stats_all <- d %>%
      group_by(Sex) %>% #grouping variable (sex)
      get_summary_stats(Age_yr) #summary of continues variables 'feb23age'

summary_stats_all
```
When is only adults.

```{r, echo = F}
summary_stats_all <- d %>%
  filter(Age_class == "adult") %>%
      group_by(Sex) %>% #grouping variable (sex)
      get_summary_stats(Age_yr) #summary of continues variables 'feb23age'

summary_stats_all
```

age at death across sex. it dosenÂ´t seem like there is a difference in death age across sex or age category.
Although we have very little deaths of juveniles recorded...

```{r, echo = F}
d %>%
  filter(Fate_probable == "dead") %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>% #grouping variable (sex)
  get_summary_stats(Age_yr)

d %>%
  filter(Fate_probable == "dead") %>%
   filter(Age_class == "adult") %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>% #grouping variable (sex)
  get_summary_stats(Age_yr)

d %>%
  filter(Fate_probable == "dead") %>%
   filter(Age_class == "juvenile") %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>% #grouping variable (sex)
  get_summary_stats(Age_yr)
```
